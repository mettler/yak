The Yak

By Hilaire Belloc
          
As a friend to the children commend me the Yak.   
   You will find it exactly the thing:
It will carry and fetch, you can ride on its back,   
   Or lead it about with a string.

The Tartar who dwells on the plains of Thibet   
   (A desolate region of snow)
Has for centuries made it a nursery pet,   
   And surely the Tartar should know!

Then tell your papa where the Yak can be got,   
   And if he is awfully rich
He will buy you the creatureâ€”or else he will not.
   (I cannot be positive which.)
